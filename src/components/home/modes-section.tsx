      question: "How can I improve team productivity?",
      answer: "To improve team productivity, implement clear communication channels, establish measurable goals, and provide regular feedback. Consider using productivity tools like Asana or Trello to track projects, and schedule regular retrospectives to identify and remove bottlenecks. Additionally, encourage work-life balance to prevent burnout, which can significantly impact long-term productivity."

      question: "Can you suggest a good movie for tonight?",
      answer: "Hey there! For movie night, how about checking out 'Everything Everywhere All At Once'? It's this amazing blend of comedy, action, and heartfelt moments that'll keep you entertained the whole time! It's got Michelle Yeoh being absolutely fantastic, and trust me, you'll be talking about it for days! Grab some popcorn and enjoy! Let me know what you think if you watch it! ðŸ˜Š"

      bgColor: "bg-purple-500/10",
      question: "What's a good hobby to try?",
      answer: "So like, photography could be pretty cool to get into. Just grab your phone to start - no need for fancy gear right away. You can just wander around your neighborhood and snap whatever catches your eye. Super low-pressure, and you can share the pics on Instagram if you want, or just keep 'em for yourself. It's all good either way, ya know?"

      borderColor: "border-amber-500",
      bgColor: "bg-amber-500/10",
      question: "How should I address a dignitary in correspondence?",
      answer: "When addressing a dignitary in formal correspondence, one must adhere to proper protocol. For ambassadors, the appropriate salutation is 'Your Excellency.' For government ministers, 'The Honorable' is the correct form of address. It is imperative that one researches the specific titles associated with the individual's position to ensure the utmost propriety is maintained throughout the communication."

      question: "Tell me a short story about a robot.",
      answer: "In a city where rain fell like digital tears, ARIA-7 collected forgotten dreams. Each night, she'd unfold her copper wings and dance between rooftops, gathering the whispers humans abandoned in sleep. She stored them in her crystal heartâ€”not because she was programmed to, but because she'd discovered something her creators never intended: the dreams glowed warmer when kept together. By morning, she'd return to her charging station, secretly nurturing the kaleidoscope of human imagination pulsing within her circuits."
